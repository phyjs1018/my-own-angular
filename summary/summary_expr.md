literal expression
- That the expression parser runs internally in two phases: Lexing and parsing.
- How the parser deals with integers, floating point numbers, and scientific notation.
- That the functions returned by the parser have additional attributes called literal and constant that carry information about the nature of the expression.
- How the parser deals with strings.
- How the parser deals with literal booleans and null.
- How the parser deals with whitespace - by ignoring it.
- How the parser deals with arrays and objects, and how it recursively parses their contents.

lookup and function call expression
- How Angular expressions do attribute lookup with dot and square bracket syntax
- How code generation is used to achieve arbitraily nested attribute lookups without having to loop at evalution time
