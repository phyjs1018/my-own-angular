literal expression
- That the expression parser runs internally in two phases: Lexing and parsing.
- How the parser deals with integers, floating point numbers, and scientific notation.
- That the functions returned by the parser have additional attributes called literal and constant that carry information about the nature of the expression.
- How the parser deals with strings.
- How the parser deals with literal booleans and null.
- How the parser deals with whitespace - by ignoring it.
- How the parser deals with arrays and objects, and how it recursively parses their contents.
